The title and description were not being indexed for each “page” in our documentation
Google was not crawling all of the links in our documentation
The good news is that Google DOES render the AngularJS application and indexes the content after the JavaScript has finished rendering! So people were finding our topics through Google, but the results they saw in Google were bad." />
